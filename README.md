Welcome to the firmware development repository for the F302R8 STM32 MCU-based motor controller kit. This repository serves as a foundational setup for developing motor control applications, with the eventual goal of transitioning to the STM32 Motor Control SDK (MCSDK) to generate drivers for our custom applications.

## Getting Started

For detailed instructions on setting up your environment and development workflow, please refer to the following wiki pages:

1. [How to setup your environment?](https://github.com/MSU-Solar/motor_controller_schip/wiki/How-to-setup-your-environment%3F)  
   This page covers the prerequisites, tool downloads, and basic setup instructions required before you start development.

2. [How to Develop and Maintain?](https://github.com/MSU-Solar/motor_controller_schip/wiki/How-to-Develop-and-Maintain%3F)  
   This page outlines the development workflow, including branch management, testing, continuous integration, and best practices for maintaining the repository.

### Prerequisites

Refer to the [How to setup your environment?](https://github.com/MSU-Solar/motor_controller_schip/wiki/How-to-setup-your-environment%3F) page for detailed information on the necessary tools and setup instructions.

### Contribution Workflow

For guidelines on how to contribute to the project, including issue tracking, pull request guidelines, and code formatting, check out the [How to Develop and Maintain?](https://github.com/MSU-Solar/motor_controller_schip/wiki/How-to-Develop-and-Maintain%3F) page.

### Future Work

We plan to transition towards leveraging the **STM32 Motor Control SDK (MCSDK)** for generating drivers tailored to our custom applications. This will enhance the scalability and maintainability of our motor control system.
